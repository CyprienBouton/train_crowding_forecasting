    The data comes from infra-red sensors located above each door of the \
        rolling stocks (NAT, R2N) in ÃŽle-de-France, measuring the number of \
        alighting and boarding passengers per door. This data is captured in \
        real time and is accessible only at the train scale for this challenge.
            
    The columns, i.e., the features, are split into 6 contextual variables such \
        as day, train id, etc. and 6 lag variables:
